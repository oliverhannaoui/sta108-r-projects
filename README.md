# sta108-r-projects
Displaying two R projects completed for my Regression Analysis (STA108) course at UC Davis.

### **Project I** 
Includes 6 parts (Introduction, Summarizing Data, Diagnostics, Analysis, Interpretation, Prediction Results, and Conclusion).

The **hospital.csv** data was collected as part of the SENIC project, and the overall goal of the project is to build a model to predict a patient’s risk of infection based on how many days they are in the hospital.

Column 1, Days, describes the number of days a patient has been in the hospital. 

Column 2, Infect, is the estimated probability of an infection for the patient.

### **Project II** 

Includes model creation for predictions, confidence intervals, simulatenous confidence intervals using Bonferroni and Scheffe’s multiplier, as well as hypothesis test to 
find the "best" model.

**salary1.csv**:

Column 1, *sl*, The three month salary of the subject in dollars (Y).

Column 2, *yd*, The number of years since the subject earned their highest degree (X1) (i.e., years of experience).

Column 3, *dg*, The highest degree earned (doctorate, masters) of the subject (X2).

**salary2.csv**:

Column 1, *sl*, The three month salary of the subject in dollars (Y).

Column 2, *yd*, The number of years since the subject earned their highest degree (X1) (i.e., years of experience).

Column 3, *dg*, The highest degree earned (doctorate, masters) of the subject (X2).

Column 4, *sx*, The gender of the subject (male, female) (X3).

Column 5, *rk*,  The rank of the subject (assistant, associate, full) (X4).
